- [ ] Model loading failures are handled gracefully

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: "ModuleNotFoundError"
**Solution**: Ensure all dependencies are installed:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Issue 2: "FileNotFoundError: Model not found"
**Solution**: 
1. Run the `03_modeling.ipynb` notebook completely
2. Ensure model files exist in `/models/` directory:
   - `music_effect_model.pkl`
   - `label_encoder.pkl`
   - `feature_columns.pkl`

### Issue 3: App doesn't start
**Solution**:
1. Check if port 8501 is already in use
2. Try a different port: `streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py --server.port 8502`
3. Check Python path and virtual environment

### Issue 4: Recommendations not showing
**Solution**:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify model predictions are working
3. Check data preprocessing steps

### Issue 5: Slow performance
**Solution**:
1. Check model size and loading time
2. Consider caching with `@st.cache_data`
3. Optimize recommendation algorithm
