    "## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives\n",
    "1. **Enhanced Music Features**: Create categorical and combined music features\n",
    "2. **User Profiling**: Develop user personas based on mental health patterns\n",
    "3. **Temporal Features**: Extract time-based patterns for better recommendations\n",
    "4. **Interaction Features**: Create features that capture relationships between variables\n",
    "5. **Mood Prediction Features**: Engineer features specifically for mood improvement prediction\n",
    "6. **Recommendation Features**: Prepare features for the final recommendation system\n",
